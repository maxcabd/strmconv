# strmconv

.anmstrm converter for the Ultimate Ninja STORM series

## Usage

* Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/maxcabd/strmconv/releases).
* Drag and drop **BOTH** the strm .xfbin (`d30_10.strm.xfbin`) and .xml (`d30_10.xml`) onto the exe.
* You'll recieve a new .xfbin `d30_10.anm.xfbin`, for example. 
* If you're missing effects and particles don't forget to load the files `d30_10e.xfbin` & `d30_1k.xfbin`. Enjoy.
